# JavaScript Fundamentals Quiz

## Description

This project was provided as a challenge to protray how companies may provide a typical coding assessment as an interview process, and this project prepares us in looking for our own questions and answers and making it as a practice Quiz for ourselves. This project was fully built by scratch.

## Features
This website features a header with your given time to complete the test and a button to view previous scores after completing a test. When the button "Start Quiz" has been clicked on, the timer will start going down and you are provided with a series of questions. The timer will decrease 10 seconds if an answer is wrong. If you wait long enough the quiz will end, however if you finish the quiz you are asked to enter your initials and be presented with an updated Highscores page.

## Future Plans
I do intend to go back on this project to change the aesthetic and look for my own questions I can use the study before interviews. Maybe an option before starting the quiz, you are provided with some questions that would reflect on the quiz. For example, "how many questions do you want?", (number of questions changes the timer count) "what level of difficulty?" (shorter or longer timer?).
