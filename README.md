# JavaScript Fundamentals Quiz

## Description

You are introduced to the intro-screen where you can click on two different buttons. You can view the Highscores on the top left, and it will take you to another page that will show your scores and will save those scores even if you exit the page. The other button is the Start Button, it will start the quiz and you will be presented with some JavaScript Funadmental questions. When you start the quiz, the timer on the top right will start counting down. If you wait long enough the quiz will end, however if you finish the quiz you are asked to enter your initials and be presented with an updated Highscores page.

A big challenge I had and the most difficulty was the JavaScript, however after watching a lot of videos, viewing multiple repositories, I took a lot, and learned how there was so many different ways to create a quiz that used a similar, yet different code. At the end of my journey, I came across another error that I couldn't find a solution to: my index.html couldn't recognize the href link to the highscores.html. This was only for GitHub however, and it worked perfectly fine on VS Code, so I asked a buddy of mine with some assistance in using GitHub the right way.

This project was created and recommended by my Bootcamp, and it was a fun project. I especially loved my experience in having multiple pages. I created this project with a means to replicate the example, practicing to create a website based on replicating what the costumer wanted. However I do plan on editing the CSS file to make it stand out more and pelasing to look at in another way.
